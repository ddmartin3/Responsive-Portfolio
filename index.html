				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<p>
				<img src="http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/c0.0.1079.1079/18809119_1689017501393036_1889673588902985728_n.jpg"/> Darwood Martin was born in Tucson Arizona sometime in that period of graft and corruption known as the 1980s during which the major decisions on how to run the country were made (with the help of his wife's astrologer), by a senile old man whose administration had sold weapons to terrorists in order to fund our own terroists in a deal that also filled the cities of Los Angeles and Chicago with cocain.  None of that has anything to do with Darwood though (However if you would like to discuss it, Darwood loves talking about politics.)  He grew up drug free in Tucson with his parents and brother, graduated from Palo Verde High School, brielfy attended the U of A, learned how to fix cars at UTI, and somehow made his way back to tech.

				Darwood is an avid motorcyclist and has not used a car in daily life since 2013.  He fixes them every day at his day job though.  He enjoys taking long trips on motorcycles and participated in his first motorcycle endurance rally in August of 2017, riding 1,538 miles in 32 hours.  His friends call him a tech junky because of his intrest in drones, electric vehicles, computers, and 3d printing.  He does like tech, he even perfers to read on a Kindle than read an actual book.  He is also obssessed with audiobooks.  His Audible library currently contains over 70 books, most of them finished. The motorcycle in the picture is electric.  In June of 2016 he rode that motorycle to Colorado Springs to see the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.  On the way, due to a chance encounter, he learned how to flyfish.  Darwood decided to sign up for the UA Coding Bootcamp in the hopes that coding might someday support a life on the road.  If not, he'll at least have more money for motorcycles. âœŒ
